##Letâ€™s say that you have two structures (object_1, object_2) and you want to align them. You only need to type the following in the PyMOL console.

align object_1, object_2

##Select the chain or residues of interest: You can use the sele command to specify the chain or residues of interest that you want to align.

# Select chain A of object_1 (first protein loaded)
sele chain_A, object_1 and chain A 

# Select a range of residues (100-150) from object_2 
sele region, object_2 and resi 100-150


Align the selected chain or residues: You can use the align command to align the selected chain or residues to the other protein structure.

# Aligning object_1 to a range of residues in object_2
align object_1, region 

# Aligning obect_2 to chain A of object 1
align object_2, chain_A

##Align the two objects containing the alpha carbons:

align ca_protein1, ca_protein2

##Something you could do is to load both the initial and final frames (you can get them via gmx trjconv) of the simulation and align two ligands based on their names and residue codes (resn) using the sele command in  PyMOL.

# Load ligands
load protein1.pdb, object1  
load protein2.pdb, object2  

# Extract ligands with residue name "LIG" in objects ligand1 and ligand2
sele ligand1, object1 and resn LIG  
sele ligand2, object2 and resn LIG
